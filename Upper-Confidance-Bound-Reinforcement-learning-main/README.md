UCB is a deterministic algorithm meaning that there is no factor of uncertainty or probability.
UCB is a deterministic algorithm for Reinforcement Learning that focuses on exploration and exploitation based on a confidence boundary that the algorithm assigns to each machine on each round of exploration. (A round is when a player pulls the arm of a machine)
