# Thompson-Sampling-Reinforcement-Learning
Thompson Sampling is an algorithm that follows exploration and exploitation to maximize the cumulative rewards obtained by performing an action. Thompson Sampling is also sometimes referred to as Posterior Sampling or Probability Matching.
An action is performed multiple times which is called exploration and based on the results obtained from the actions, either rewards or penalties, further actions are performed with the goal to maximize the reward which is called exploitation. In other words, new choices are explored to maximize rewards while exploiting the already explored choices.
