# Hierarchical-Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which is used to group the unlabeled datasets into a cluster and also known as hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA.
In this algorithm, we develop the hierarchy of clusters in the form of a tree, and this tree-shaped structure is known as the dendrogram.
There is no requirement to predetermine the number of clusters as we did in the K-Means algorithm.
So, as we have seen in the K-means clustering that there are some challenges with this algorithm, which are a predetermined number of clusters, and it always tries to create the clusters of the same size. To solve these two challenges, we can opt for the hierarchical clustering algorithm because, in this algorithm, we don't need to have knowledge about the predefined number of clusters.
